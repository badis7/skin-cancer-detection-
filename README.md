# skin_cancer_detection

# Introduction
An algorithm that can visually diagnose melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. In particular, algorithm will distinguish this malignant skin tumor from two types of benign lesions (nevi and seborrheic keratoses).

The data and objective are pulled from the 2017 ISIC Challenge on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection. As part of the challenge, participants were tasked to design an algorithm to diagnose skin lesion images as one of three different skin diseases (melanoma, nevus, or seborrheic keratosis). In this project, you will create a model to generate your own predictions.

# Getting Started
Clone the repository and create a data/ folder to hold the dataset of skin images.

```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/dermatologist-ai.git
mkdir data; cd data
```
Create folders to hold the training, validation, and test images.

```
mkdir train; mkdir valid; mkdir test
```
Download and unzip the [training data](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-dlnfd/datasets/skin-cancer/train.zip) (5.3 GB).

Download and unzip the [validation data](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-dlnfd/datasets/skin-cancer/validation.zip)(824.5 MB).

Download and unzip the [test data](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-dlnfd/datasets/skin-cancer/test.zip) (5.1 GB).

Place the training, validation, and test images in the `data/` folder, at `data/train/`, `data/valid/`, and `data/test/`, respectively. Each folder should contain three sub-folders `(melanoma/, nevus/, seborrheic_keratosis/)`, each containing representative images from one of the three image classes.
